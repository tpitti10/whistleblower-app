# whistleblower-app
Throughout the Spring 2024 semester, my class, Advanced Software Developments, assinged groups to complete a semester long project. We were tasked with making a software system - a “whistleblower” app that used Python, PostgreSQL, Django, GitHub, Heroku, and Amazon S3. It also had to incorporate Google user accounts and allow for four types of users: anonymous, common user, site admin, Django admin.

My particular role on the team was Scrum Master. I was responsible for keeping everyone on track, facilitating all team meetings, and monitoring team status / issues.
In terms of project development, I contributed significantly to the coding. My contributions included styling all the webpages using Bootstrap, JavaFx, and html. I also helped with allowing users to be able to upload an image (pdf or jpg), and be able to view their submitted image directly on the site. Thougout development, I tested and debugged a lot of our code to ensure that the app would never crash.
